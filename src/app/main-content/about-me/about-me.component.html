        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I am Cihad Isen, a Frontend Developer based in Berlin, Germany.<br>
            During my training at the Developer Academy, I was able to acquire the necessary skills in frontend
            development through well-structured and intensive projects. These skills were further strengthened in some
            larger projects, where I collaborated with a team, enhancing my communication and teamwork abilities.

            <img src="./../../../assets/img/lightbulb.png"> Customer interaction has always been familiar to me,
            allowing me to develop considerable patience in dealing with people over the years. During my training, I
            also worked intensively to meet the strict project requirements in every free moment, which further
            heightened my ability to work under pressure.

            <img src="./../../../assets/img/puzzle.png"> Through discipline and perseverance, I have strengthened my
            skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as working with Angular, during the course of my training. This
            enabled me to create, among other things, a task management tool and a small game, both of which you can see
            for yourself.

        <p>
            I am always eager to continue learning and expanding my experiences. As the world and technology evolve, so
            do I!
